# AVClass and AVClass2

AVClass and AVClass2 are Python tools to tag / label malware samples. 
You give them as input the AV labels for a large number of malware samples (e.g., VirusTotal JSON reports) 
and they output tags extracted from the AV labels of each sample. 
The original AVClass only outputs family names (i.e., family tags). 
By default, it outputs the most likely family for each sample (e.g., *zbot*, *virut*). 
It can also output a ranking of all alternative family names it found for each sample.
The newer AVClass2, in addition to family names, also outputs other tags capturing the malware class (e.g., *worm*, *ransomware*, *grayware*), behaviors (e.g., *spam*, *ddos*), and file properties (e.g., *packed*, *themida*, *bundle*, *nsis*). 

A quick example helps illustrating the differences. If you run AVClass2 on our example input file:

```shell
$./avclass2/avclass2_labeler.py -lb examples/malheurReference_lb.json -p
```

the output on stdout is:

```
aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 33 CLASS:grayware|10,CLASS:grayware:adware|9,FILE:os:windows|8,FAM:adrotator|8,CLASS:downloader|3,FAM:zlob|2
67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d 37 CLASS:dialer|23,FILE:os:windows|9,FAM:adultbrowser|8,CLASS:dialer:porndialer|7,CLASS:grayware|6,CLASS:grayware:tool|3,FAM:target|2
```
which means sample *aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539* 
was flagged by 33 AV engines and 10 of them agree it is *grayware*, 9 that it is more specifically *adware*, 
8 mention that it runs on *windows*, another 8 that it is the *adrotator* family, 
3 that it is a *downloader*, and 2 that it belongs instead to the *zlob* family.
Sample *67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d* is flagged by 37 AV engines and 23 of them 
consider it a *dialer*, 8 that it belongs to the *adultbrowser* family, and so on.

If you instead run AVClass on the same input file:

```shell
$./avclass/avclass_labeler.py -lb examples/malheurReference_lb.json
```

the output looks like this:

```
aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 adrotator
67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d adultbrowser
``` 

which simply reports the most common family name for each sample.

In a nutshell, that is the main difference between both tools. 
Of course, there are more options for both tools, 
which you can read about in their corresponding README files. 


## Which tool should I use?

You should use AVClass2. It is the newer tool, extracts more information 
from the input AV labels, and has a compatibility mode to be used for 
family labeling in the same way that the original AVClass. 

AVClass is no longer updated and may be deprecated in the near future. 
For example, we add family aliases and generic terms from time to time 
for AVClass2, but we are not currently adding them for AVClass.

The main reason to keep the original AVClass around is because in research, 
reproducibility can be important. 
Other researchers may have their own reasons to compare against an older tool. 
However, as a researcher, if you compare against the original AVClass, 
you should also include AVClass2 in the comparison.

The only benefit of the original AVClass is that it is slightly 
faster than AVClass2 since it extracts less info. 
It is unlikely that the lower runtime makes a significant difference 
for most users, but worth mentioning it in case you process many 
millions of samples and do not require the extra info AVClass2 provides. 

## Evaluating and comparing with AVClass/AVClass2

Other researchers may want to independently evaluate AVClass/AVClass2 and
to compare it with their own approaches.
We encourage such evaluation, feedback on limitations, and proposals for
improvement.
However, we have observed a number of common errors in such evaluations that 
should be avoided. Below is the quick summary. 
A more detailed explanation is in the [evaluation page](EVALUATION.md)

1. AVClass2 has superseeded AVClass, so your evaluation should include AVClass2, not only the original AVClass. 
2. For malware labeling, please use AVClass2 compatibility mode (-c command line option).
3. Tagging more samples is not an evaluation goal by itself, the tags need to be accurate. For example, it is known that allowing tags from a single AV engine or ignoring generic tags will enable tagging more samples, but it will introduce incorrect tags. 
4. You need ground truth to evaluate the accuracy/precision/recall of AVClass/AVClass2.
5. You should also evaluate scalability (runtime and memory usage) since that is a major design goal of AVClass/AVClass2
6. Note that AVClass2 and AVClass may not provide the same family tag for all samples when run on the same AV labels.
7. AVClass2/AVClass are not malware detection tools, please do not try to evaluate them for that scenario.

## Why are AVClass and AVClass2 useful?

Because a lot of times security researchers want to extract family and other 
information from AV labels, but this process is not as simple as it looks, 
especially if you need to do it for large numbers (e.g., millions) of samples. 
Some advantages of AVClass and AVClass2 are:

1. *Automatic.* They remove manual analysis limitations on the size of the 
input 
dataset.

2. *Vendor-agnostic.* They operate on the labels of any available set of AV 
engines, which can vary from sample to sample.

3. *Cross-platform.* They can be used for any platforms supported by AV 
engines, e.g., Windows or Android malware.

4. *Does not require executables.* AV labels can be obtained from online services
 like VirusTotal using a sample's hash, even when the executable is not available.

5. *Quantified accuracy.* We have evaluated AVClass and AVClass2 on millions of 
samples and publicly available malware datasets with ground truth. 
Evaluation details are in the RAID 2016 and ACSAC 2020 papers.

6. *Open source.* The code is available and we are happy to incorporate 
suggestions and improvements so that the security community benefits from 
these tools.

## Limitations

The main limitations of AVClass and AVClass2 are that its output depends 
on the input AV labels. 
Both tools try to compensate for the noise on the AV labels, 
but cannot identify tags if AV engines do not provide non-generic tokens 
in the labels of a sample. 
In particular, they cannot tag samples if at least 2 AV engines 
do not agree on a tag. 

Still, there are many samples that both tools can tag
and thus we believe you will find them useful.
We recommend you to read the RAID 2016 and ACSAC 2020 papers for more details.

## Input JSON format

AVClass and AVClass2 support three input JSON formats: 

1. VirusTotal v2 API JSON reports (*-vt file*), 
where each line in the input *file* should be the full JSON of a 
VirusTotal v2 API response to the */file/report* endpoint,
e.g., obtained by querying https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/file/report?apikey={apikey}&resource={hash}
There is an example VirusTotal v2 input file in examples/vtv2_sample.json

```shell
$./avclass2/avclass2_labeler.py -vt examples/vtv2_sample.json -p > output.txt
```

2. VirusTotal v3 API JSON reports (*-vt file -vt3*), 
where each line in the input *file* should be the full JSON of a VirusTotal API version 3 response with a *File* object report, 
e.g., obtained by querying https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/{hash}
There is an example VirusTotal v3 input file in examples/vtv3_sample.json

```shell
$./avclass2/avclass2_labeler.py -vt examples/vtv3_sample.json -p -vt3 > output.txt
```

3. Simplified JSON (*-lb file*),
where each line in *file* should be a JSON 
with (at least) these fields:
{md5, sha1, sha256, av_labels}. 
There is an example of such input file in *examples/malheurReference_lb.json*

```shell
$./avclass2/avclass2_labeler.py -lb examples/malheurReference_lb.json -p > output.txt
```

**Why have a simplified JSON format?**

We believe most users will get the AV labels using VirusTotal. 
However, AVClass and AVClass2 are IO-bound and a VirusTotal report 
in addition to the AV labels and hashes includes 
much other data that the tools do not need. 
Thus, when applying AVClass or AVClass2 to millions of samples,
reducing the input file size by removing unnnecessary data 
significantly improves efficiency. 
Furthermore, users could obtain AV labels from other sources and 
the simpler the input JSON format, 
the easier to convert those AV labels into an input file.
